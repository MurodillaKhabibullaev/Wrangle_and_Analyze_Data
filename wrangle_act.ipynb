    ">**Yeah, Hi guys! Are you here?** We have diven into wrangling process and have done a lot of job so far. You might think It must be very exhausting job to try it myself. Or Maybe you wondering, Why is it so important to us?! And instead what about taking more pictures and posting it to twitter, It might be more useful! Probably, you are right! But when you try it, you realise where is the magic happens! Yeah, so far we have done many many tasks in the wrangling step may be you don't understand most of them. And Sometimes you can't catch up some actions we have done. Maybe you have got some questions on your mind? Why we have changed some datatypes? Why we have dropped some columns? or Something else is blowing on your mind. It is all about datatypes and data quality or data tidiness issues. To work with data we need clean data as much as possible to make right decisions. Right decisions? When I posting my dogs picture on twitter? What does it matter? Ok, you are probably right when you posting your dogs picture on twitter. It doesn't matter wheather people favorite your dog or not. Because you like it. You don't need anything else. But consider you are an market related person, and you need to know which product you must deliver for people to get more profit and more clients like getting more favourite on twitter. When you are on the situation like this, you must know how to work with data, datatypes and how to manipulate it or how to gather, assess or clean it. At this time, WeRateDogs comes handy for practising and developing some skills. So, let's continue our investigation with the new cleaned data and see what happens at the end.\n",

You have seen the dataset includes a lot of information and also several columns. If we use the information and columns effectively for rating our dogs, we can say 'we have been fair!'. Fair rating also very useful in the real world, because you can't be lead to wrong decisions and will get profit from that.\n",
